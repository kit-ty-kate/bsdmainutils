Description: collection of more utilities from FreeBSD
 This package contains lots of small programs many people expect to find when
 they use a BSD-style Unix system.
 .
 Included are: banner, ncal, cal, calendar, col, colcrt, colrm, column, from,
 hexdump, look, lorder, ul, write.

 This package used to contain whois and vacation, which are now distributed in
 their own packages. Also here was tsort, which is now in the "coreutils"
 package.
